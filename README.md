## Description

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the effect of DIDP and CP for SUALBP.

## Building

Run the .py files in the folder [scripts](scripts)

## Results

Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and Tables 5, 6, 7 are based on all the .csv files in the folder [results](results)

## Replicating

To replicate the results in the paper, read and run the .py files in the folder [scripts](scripts). They will run instances in the [data](data) folder.
